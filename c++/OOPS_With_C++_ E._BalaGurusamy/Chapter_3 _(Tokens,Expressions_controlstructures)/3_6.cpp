3.6: A cricket has the following table of batting figure for a series of test matches:
Playerâ€™s name       Run         Innings         Time not out
    Sachin          8430          230               18
    Saurav          4200          130               9
    Rahul           3350          105               11
      .               .            .                 .
      .               .            .                 .

Write a program to read the figures set out in the above forms, to calculate the batting averages 
and to print out the complete table including the averages.\
