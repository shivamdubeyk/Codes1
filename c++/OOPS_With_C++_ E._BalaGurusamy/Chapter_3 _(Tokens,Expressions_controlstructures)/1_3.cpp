/*
First, in the allocateMemory function, you're trying to assign a string to str, 
but str is not declared in that function. 
You should declare str inside allocateMemory and then assign the string to it.
 Also, you should use char* for strings, but you're trying to assign a string directly,
  which won't work. 
  
Next, in your main function, 
you should allocate memory using the new keyword to match the memory allocation in the allocateMemory function.
 Also, you don't need to delete str because it's allocated in allocateMemory, 
 and you should avoid assigning a string directly to it like " "
